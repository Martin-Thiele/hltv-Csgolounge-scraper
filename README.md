# hltv-Csgolounge-scraper
A scraper for hltv.org and csgolounge.com, written for my project: www.brintos.dk/csgo

This is a scraper written in java with the purpose of scraping latest matches and results from hltv.org, 
as well as gathering odds from csgolounge.com. These results are then added to a database consisting of CS:GO players, teams, maps,
matches, and competitions
